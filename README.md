# R scripts

Welcome everyone! 

This repository was created with student collaboration in mind. If you have an **R** script that you think might be useful for others please feel free to share here (See the [STATA](https://github.com/UCSF-DEB-students/stata_scripts) and [other scripts](https://github.com/UCSF-DEB-students/other_language_scripts) for more) . 
Here are a few tips to make it useful to others:

* Describe the purpose and a brief background.   
  Provide the motivation to create the script, the problem that you faced and your proposed solution(s), what kind of data you used, in which setting (longitudinal vs cross-sectional).  
  Provide the required libraries (if any) to run your script.
  
* Make it reproducible   
  It is understandable that most of the times others will not have the same dataset that you did when creating the script. However, if possible provide with a small sample of the data or simulate it within the script to mimic the structure of the original data.  
  If you run RMarkdown the resulting file will have the output in which case you might not need to provide sample data. However, it is easier to look/share the source code as well.

* Comment/Annotate  
  Making coments is helpful to explan what the code is doing in a speicific line or block of code. Your future-self will thank you as well!
  
* Don't be affraid!  
  This repository is, by no means, meant to propose only the best or the perfect solution for a problem. Rather, is a place of collaboration where we (students) can help eachother with code and find solutions to common problems when coding for data analysis TOGETHER.
